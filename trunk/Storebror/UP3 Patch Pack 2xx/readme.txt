UP3 RC4 Patch Pack v2.02

Contents:
- All fixes listed below
- All feature enhancements listed below
- UP3 RC4 without obfuscation
- SAS Common Utils v1.09

Included feature enhancements:
- Replication of aircraft control surfaces movement over the net and through NTRK recordings
- Replication of pilot head movement over the net and through NTRK recordings
- Animated AI pilot heads, according to pilot's task (watch wing leader, watch enemy etc.)
- Screenshots taken in native code, much faster than before
- "Stabs4All" included, can be activated through conf.ini (*)
- New DiffFM included, capable of reading different FM file versions, less intrusive
- I-16 Planes can hook to TB-3 SPB bombers in flight.
  Hook Parameters on Ground: Distance to hook point max. 5m
  Hook Parameters in Air: Distance to hook point max. 15m, speed difference max. 30km/h, flight vector difference max. 25 degrees
- G4M-2 and Ohka flying bomb can be hooked to each other on ground now (max. distance to hook point: 50m)
- Ju-88 Mistel and 109/190 fighter aircraft can be hooked to each other on ground now (max. distance to hook point: 50m) (needs further testing)
- Torpedo drop parameters shown in command menu (default: Tab key)
- Torpedo water impact values shown in HUD log on impact
- Implemented "smooth" limits for torpedo drop parameters.
  When the drop limits (entry speed, impact angle) are exceeded, the torpedo doesn't break immediately,
  but with a probability according to the proportion of the exceedance vs. the original limits
- WYSIWYG:
  New "smooth" Torpedo Engagement Limits,
  Random Bomb, Rocket, Ordnance drop spread,
  bouncing bombs on water (skip-bombing),
  Detonation Delay (Bomb fuze) settings and
  Random Explosion Radii get replicated over the net, so that everyone sees what you see
  (and your NTRK playbacks always look the same like original as well)

- Wheels turn when plane starts to roll, not just when it rolls with more than 5 km/h
- AI doesn't proceed to further Ground Attack waypoints anymore when there's nothing left to attack with
- AI avoids collisions also when flying heavy planes, as long as they're not much heavier than the plane they're about to collide with.
  In the latter case it's the smaller plane's responsibility to avoid the collision.

(*) Me-262V3 flight model:
    Like in real life, you have to tap the brakes in order to get the 262V3 off the ground.
    Let the plane accelerate to 180km/h, tap the brakes until the tail comes up and you will soon get airborne automatically.
    Remember to move the throttle gently below 6000rpm.
    VERY GENTLY!
    This plane is equipped with very early stages of the Jumo 004 jet engines which are still under development.
    The specified spool up time from idle to full throttle is ==>> 40 Seconds <<==
    This means that e.g. when using keyboard for throttle, you're allowed to increase throttle by one step (=5%) every 2 seconds only !!
    You might be lucky and manage to spool up within half of that time (20 seconds) but we cannot guarantee that the engines will survive it.
    If you spool up any faster, your engines will go up in flames, mark these words!
    The same applies when you throttle back: GENTLY!
    You can do it quicker than throttling up, actually about twice as fast, but you still have to do it GENTLY once you fall below 6000rpm.
    That much for the bad news about the engines, the good news is that above 6000rpm you can move the throttle as quick as you like.
    Watch your RPMs!
    
    Note: * Trim setting for ground start is "full up".
            It will be applied automatically on ground start, however if you have a joystick axis attached for elevator trim,
            remember to trim up all the way when you start on ground, otherwise you risk to nose over when you tap the brakes.
          * Don't let the plane accelerate beyond 200 km/h without lifting the tail.
            Otherwise eventually the wings might lift the plane into the air (especially with low fuel load),
            but you have no elevator authority yet since they're still wing alee: -> Crash.
          * Don't tap the brakes too soon when you try to lift the tail.
            If you do so below ~160km/h, the tail will come up, but since you don't have sufficient elevator authority yet, your plane will nose over.
    
    ATTENTION: If you have installed PA_Jeronimo's Engine Cowling Mod, please deactivate the Me-262V-3 folder inside of that mod, otherwise
               Your engine will get damage once started on ground, see deactivation details below.

IMPORTANT: If you have PA_Jeronimo's Engine Cowling Mod installed in your game, please make sure to Rename the folder
           3do/plane/Me-262V-3
           inside that mod folder (e.g. the path in your game might be like "#UP#\Fixed cowling engine & props\3do\plane\Me-262V-3") to
           3do/plane/-Me-262V-3
           or simply remove the "Me-262V-3" of it.
           If you don't do so, your engines will die on ground start.
