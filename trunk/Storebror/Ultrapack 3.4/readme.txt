Ultrapack 3.3 Bigfoot + Patch 6

Installation:

Download all parts of the installer (5 in total).
Run the installer ("Ultrapack 3.3 Bigfoot.part1.exe") and let the installer do it's job.
At the end, JSGME will open up. "#UP#_Enable_UP3.3" (that's Ultrapack 3.3 "Bigfoot") will be enabled automatically and you can choose additional JSGME Options as you like.
NOTE: Activating #UP#_Enable_UP3.3 takes LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time as it contains lots of files.
      JSGME might seem non-resonding but it isn't. Really. 10 Minutes? Easily. Wait. Be patient.
ATTENTION: Do _NOT_ enable "#UP#_Enable_UP3.0" and/or "#UP#_Enable_UP3.2", there's no need to anymore, it's outdated.

Next, Download Ultrapack 3.3 Bigfoot Patch 6, run the installer (Ultrapack 3.3 Bigfoot Patch 6.exe) and let it do it's job.
At the end, JSGME will open up and attempt to enable "#UP#_Enable_UP3.3_Patch_06".
Since this Patch overwrites existing files, you will see a warning message.
Please click "Yes" on that warning message.
NOTE: Activating #UP#_Enable_UP3.3_Patch_06 takes LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time as it contains lots of files.

- Mistel Hotfix
- FW 190 Schusszaehler Fix
- Bailout Speed Fix (players can bail out at any time now, but risk to get hurt when speed is too high)
- Explosion Fix (gets rid of the big explosion meshes on ground after large bomb detonations even if smaller bombs or actors crash later on)
- IJN Ryujo fixed
- A nasty IL-2 bug has been fixed that prevented IL-2 to actually take the month and day from a mission date into account
- Right Alt (Alt Gr) key works in Chat etc. now
- Wheels turn when plane starts to roll, not just when it rolls with more than 5 km/h
- AI doesn't proceed to further Ground Attack waypoints anymore when there's nothing left to attack with
- AI avoids collisions also when flying heavy planes, as long as they're not much heavier than the plane they're about to collide with.
  In the latter case it's the smaller plane's responsibility to avoid the collision.

(*) Me-262V3 flight model:
    Like in real life, you have to tap the brakes in order to get the 262V3 off the ground.
    Let the plane accelerate to 180km/h, tap the brakes until the tail comes up and you will soon get airborne automatically.
    Remember to move the throttle gently below 6000rpm.
    VERY GENTLY!
    This plane is equipped with very early stages of the Jumo 004 jet engines which are still under development.
    The specified spool up time from idle to full throttle is ==>> 40 Seconds <<==
    This means that e.g. when using keyboard for throttle, you're allowed to increase throttle by one step (=5%) every 2 seconds only !!
    You might be lucky and manage to spool up within half of that time (20 seconds) but we cannot guarantee that the engines will survive it.
    If you spool up any faster, your engines will go up in flames, mark these words!
    The same applies when you throttle back: GENTLY!
    You can do it quicker than throttling up, actually about twice as fast, but you still have to do it GENTLY once you fall below 6000rpm.
    That much for the bad news about the engines, the good news is that above 6000rpm you can move the throttle as quick as you like.
    Watch your RPMs!

    Note: * Trim setting for ground start is "full up".
            It will be applied automatically on ground start, however if you have a joystick axis attached for elevator trim,
            remember to trim up all the way when you start on ground, otherwise you risk to nose over when you tap the brakes.
          * Don't let the plane accelerate beyond 200 km/h without lifting the tail.
            Otherwise eventually the wings might lift the plane into the air (especially with low fuel load),
            but you have no elevator authority yet since they're still wing alee: -> Crash.
          * Don't tap the brakes too soon when you try to lift the tail.
            If you do so below ~160km/h, the tail will come up, but since you don't have sufficient elevator authority yet, your plane will nose over.

    ATTENTION: If you have installed PA_Jeronimo's Engine Cowling Mod, please deactivate the Me-262V-3 folder inside of that mod, otherwise
               Your engine will get damage once started on ground, see deactivation details below.

IMPORTANT: If you have PA_Jeronimo's Engine Cowling Mod installed in your game, please make sure to Rename the folder
           3do/plane/Me-262V-3
           inside that mod folder (e.g. the path in your game might be like "#UP#\Fixed cowling engine & props\3do\plane\Me-262V-3") to
           3do/plane/-Me-262V-3
           or simply remove the "Me-262V-3" of it.
           If you don't do so, your engines will die on ground start.
