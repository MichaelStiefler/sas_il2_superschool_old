     * @return A list of integer indices indicating the possible bomb salvo sizes. Please note that the inherited canSelectBombSalvoSize() method must return 'true' in order for the values returned here to take effect. The default values are: -1 (default
     *         fire), 0 (full salvo), 1 (single fire). Furthermore it is possible to add values from 2 - (the number of total bombs) which indicate the number of bombs released in a group release. Please note that values exceeding the total number of
     *         bombs will not be displayed. If a value is in this list, it can be selected by the pilot. Please note that 'default fire' must be always available.

     *         Please note that 'bombs' refers to instances of 'RocketGun', 'BombGun' or 'RocketBombGun' fired from Trigger 3.
